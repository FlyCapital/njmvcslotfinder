<h1><center>NJ MVC Slot Finder</center></h1>
<h2><center>We find and book New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) slots for you</center></h2>

<h2><center>Manually refreshing the NJ MVC appointment page desperately to find a time that is close enough to what you are looking for?
No problem! We can help.</center></h2>


<h2>Why us?</h2>

<p>We are capable of booking slots as close as <u>1 week.</u></p>
<p>You pay only <u>after</u> we find and book a slot you want! If we don't find a slot, you don't pay.</p>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Email the following information to <a href = "mailto: njmvc.slotfinder@gmail.com">njmvc.slotfinder@gmail.com</a></p>

<table>
  <tr><th></th></tr>
  <tr><td>1. What type of appointment (e.g. initial permit, knowledge test, license renew)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2. Intended date<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> (since exact date is not guaranteed, we prefer a range, e.g. in 1 week, 1 month, etc, also specify morning or afternoon if you have preference)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3. Preferred NJ MVC location</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4. Name</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5. Date of birth</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6. Phone number</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7. Email (this is the email you get the official MVC appointment confirmation)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>8. License Class (e.g. Class D)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>After we get your request, our team will continuously work to find a slot for you. Once we find a slot that matches, we will book it and you will get an official appointment confirmation email from NJ MVC.</p>
<p>After your appointment got confirmed, you have <u>3 days</u> to send us your payment. If we receive your payment in time then you are all set!
    If we don't get the payment after 3 days, we will cancel your appointment.</p>


<p id="footnote-1">[1] Our slot finding is on the best effort basis. As has been said, if we don't get a slot you don't pay.</p>

<p>If we need information other than the ones listed above, we will contract you.Don't worry, these information are needed to book the NJ MVC appointment (see below). We are not in the business of collecting your information.</p>
